# This is an .OBJ file to Desmos converter.
It is written in Python 3, and is very simple.
`python3 main.py` to run it! ~
[Example of an .OBJ magically transferred](https://www.desmos.com/3d/ig92tvu8yo)

Copy all the (X,Y,Z)s and put them in [Desmos 3D](https://www.desmos.com/3d). If you did it right you should see the vertices of your model.
If you're using the experimental.py version, you'll need to select every single polygon() in desmos for some reason.
And don't copy the first garbage or the last garbage. Copy everything that looks right. I don't know why it does this.
But it's somewhat worth it! [Here's a subspace tripmine model](https://www.desmos.com/3d/og0bq6xp7a) i put into desmos.
It actually has faces!
